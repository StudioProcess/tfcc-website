            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Commissioned by the MAK for the London Design Biennale 2021: Resonance and designed by Process – Studio for Art and Design, TOKENS FOR CLIMATE CARE focuses on one of today’s most urgent and essential human tasks: climate care.
              Nudged by the transformative power of design the project contributes to humanity’s evolution into a climate conscious species that takes immediate collective action for our planet.</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-4">The project uses a machine learning technique called GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), which instead of only detecting or classifying images, is capable of generating it’s own content! Based on a comprehensive database of more than 10.000 logos, symbols and glyphs, this algorithm generates completely new and original graphic symbols, the "Tokens for Climate Care". They are accessible worldwide and can be freely used by and for activism and initiatives for climate care!</p>
            <p class="mb-4">For thousands of years, humans have communicated through a language of signs and symbols. All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. Three characteristics of symbols are specifically relevant:</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Arbitrary</strong>—Symbols have no natural reason, they must be learned.<br><strong>Ambiguous</strong>—Symbols can have several meanings.<br><strong>Abstract</strong> (Representative)—Symbols are general, not specific.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Human cultures use symbols to express ideas, ideologies and social structures. They have the ability to combine symbols in an infinite variety of ways for an infinite variety of meanings.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">This is the basis for the concept of TOKENS FOR CLIMATE CARE: What if an AI were to conceive of new symbols, to create new linkages between concepts and representations?
              To ascribe meaning to the Tokens, the team previously linked the data to keywords (“labels”) that encompass social, political, environmental, and economic aspects of the climate crisis. This enables the AI to “learn” the connections between form and meaning and to independently design new, context-related symbols: the “Tokens for Climate Care”.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Visitors can select three keywords from their smartphones. These are the basis for the individual tokens. The interactive laser installation is making the generated output data visible as symbols in real time.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>The output samples are accessible worldwide through the → <a href="archive/">Archive</a> and may be used freely by and for initiatives for climate care.</strong></p>

            <p class="f700 text-uppercase mb-4">Why?</p>
            <p class="mb-4">In the last few years <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> and especially <strong>Machine Learning</strong> have become huge buzzwords. The world’s major technology companies are employing a large majority of AI researchers to create prediction products based on mountains of behavioral data they are harvesting from their users.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We believe no technology is ever inherently good or bad – but is only determined by its use. As such we want to explore the potential of machine learning for <strong>'doing good'</strong> and at the same time open up the black box of AI a bit, demystify and educate.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">As has been recently made clear by an unprecedented global movement, <strong>Climate Change is an existential threat for all of mankind</strong>. It is not a singular issue. To overcome it will require massive economic, ecologic and social changes.</p>

            <p class="f700 text-uppercase mb-4">Learning to create new content</p>
            <p class="mb-4">For realizing this project we use a machine learning technique called <strong>GAN</strong> (Generative Adversarial Network). In contrast to many other ML algorithms, which detect or classify images, this technique is capable of generating images – <strong>it creates new content!</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-4">The first step is to provide many samples for the type of image to generate. This is called the dataset. To create our <strong>dataset</strong>, we use symbols and symbol-like characters from a number of free fonts and icon sets. We use sorting and filtering in combination with hand-picking the symbols that match the complexity and aesthetics we are looking for. Using our own dataset-browser, we selected about <strong>7.000 symbols</strong> (out of over 200.000) for our initial dataset.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">In the next step we assign <strong>'meaning'</strong> to the icons in the dataset. This is done through a labeling process. It is the essential human contribution in shaping the machine algorithm. Our label set consists of about <strong>40 unique terms</strong> and focuses on (natural and artificial) resources, qualities and actions.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 mb-lg-0">We want to make labeling a collaborative process by inviting artists and designers to fill out an online questionnaire, which shows them a random series of symbols from the dataset with the task to pick an appropriate label for each one.</p>

          <b-col class="cmpx-30" lg="5" offset-lg="2" order-lg="2">
            <p class="mb-4">Now the dataset including labels can be used to <strong>'train'</strong> an artificial neural network. In this stage the samples are repeatedly fed into the network, its results evaluated and the network tweaked to produce better results. The AI learns the visual characteristics of the symbols it sees, as well as the association of labels to these visual representations. This step is somewhat time intensive and needs lots of computing power.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Finally, the trained model can be used to <strong>generate new tokens</strong>. Given an input of three words from the set of labels it will produce tokens that best represent these concepts, based on what it has learned previously. Since the tokens are pixel images at that point they will be vectorized in order to be universally usable in a graphic design context.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 mb-lg-0">At this stage Tokens for Climate Care is set up as an <strong>art project</strong>. We see it as a chance to experiment with machine learning in the context of graphic design, our main field of work.<br>The goal of this project: to implement a <strong>fully working prototype</strong>, which we can publish and gather feedback on. It will enable us to judge commercial viability, for example as a <strong>logo generator</strong>. This will incur additional costs for commercially licensing big datasets and the extensive labeling required.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">For promoting the project, we created a unique visual identity. The core of the project – new visual tokens that allow for a wide range of applications – is reflected in the communication design.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">In addition to a pre-defined typeface a range of new glyphs was designed, which can replace individual characters. Their aesthetics are based on those of the generated tokens and convey a look suitable for laser projection. Altering replacements for a single character results in multiple versions of the written text (i.e. Logotype & Headlines). This allows for animation and diverse use in print and online mediums.</p>
